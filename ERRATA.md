### Effects of .FCStd file compression on load times

I saved two versions of the same file and tried importing them with the **AddObject** command. before importing, I changed the [file compression level](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/File%20Format%20FCStd) in each file: one file was set to max compression, the other to min. This change seems to make no difference in the time it takes to execute the following code:

``` python
st = time.time()
    the_obj = self.objlist.currentText()
    fpath = os.path.join(MCBase.objpath,the_obj+".FCStd")
    importdoc = FreeCAD.openDocument(fpath,hidden=True)
    top_obj = importdoc.Part
    objlist = [top_obj,importdoc.ParamObjData] + top_obj.OutListRecursive
    Gui.Selection.clearSelection()
    for x in objlist:
      Gui.Selection.addSelection(x)
    Gui.runCommand('Std_Copy')
    Gui.Selection.clearSelection()
    FreeCAD.setActiveDocument(self.thedoc.Name)
    Gui.runCommand('Std_Paste',0)
    FreeCAD.closeDocument(importdoc.Name)
    print(f"obj import took {time.time()-st} s")
```
Both imports took ~0.12s over a few repetitions.
This result is nice, because maximizing the compression level decreased file size by over 90%! (132.1 KiB to 11.2 KiB in this case)

### Casting parameters to strings for use in expressions

FreeCAD allows us to set the *label* parameter of objects using an expression. so we can do something like this: `<<This is a string>>` (FreeCAD required strings to be enclosed in double angle brackets).
We can concatenate strings in the usual pythonic way: `<<Hello >> + <<World!>>`

Some functionality is not directly available, though. Let's say we want to include a dimension in a label. (Assume the current FreeCAD document has an object called `Part` with an `App::PropertyLength` property called `dim1`). The following expression will generate an error:

`<<A part with length>> + Part.dim1`

This behavior is due to the fact that the expression engine doesn't cast the quantity to a string. the fix is as follows:

`<<A part with length>> + Part.dim1.UserString`

### Pulling thumbnail images from .FCStd files

The "Save Picture" GUI command just runs the following python code:

``` python
Gui.activeDocument().activeView().saveImage(path_to_image,width,height,'Current')
```

Digging around in the FreeCAD source  and Python console reveals some more potentially useful things:

``` python
# with a freecad doc open:
x = Gui.activeDocument()
x.ActiveView.fitAll()
# these 2 are the same?
x.ActiveView.viewAxonometric()
x.ActiveView.viewAxometric()
# produces a very close dupe of the current 3D view
x.ActiveView.saveImage(path,400,400,"Current")
# transparent background --> potentially useful
x.ActiveView.saveImage(path,400,400,"Transparent")
# this also works, but each triangle in the rendered 
# mesh becomes an svg object --> resource intensive
x.ActiveView.saveVectorGraphic(path)
```

There is also [This Tool](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/blob/5d49bf78de785a536f941f1a6d06d432582a95d3/src/Tools/freecad-thumbnailer) in the FreeCAD source that pulls embedded thumbnails from .FCStd files. 

Actually, the entire [FreeCAD/src/Tools](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/tree/5d49bf78de785a536f941f1a6d06d432582a95d3/src/Tools) directory is worth digging through at some point in the future.

Sliptonic has some possibly relevant notes [here.](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/blob/5d49bf78de785a536f941f1a6d06d432582a95d3/src/Mod/Path/Tools/README.md#tools)

### Purge FreeCAD backup files recursively

```
find . -name "*.FCStd1" -type f -delete
```

### Convert .FCStd files to be saved as directory

Only works when running a link branch FreeCAD instance (or any FreeCAD version that supports saving as a directory).

``` python
# fileConverter.py
# save .FCStd files as unzipped folders using the
# link branches capabilities

import os
import FreeCAD

srcDir = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "ObjModels")
outDir = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "ObjModelsDir")

# converts everything in srcDir to 'saved as directory'
# files, and places them in outDir
# Note: do rm srcDir/*.FCStd1 first, otherwise this script 
# creates duplicates using those backup files
def convert_files():
    os.makedirs(outDir, exist_ok=True)
    for file in os.listdir(srcDir):
        doc = FreeCAD.openDocument(os.path.join(srcDir,file),hidden=True)
        fileName = os.path.basename(doc.FileName)
        dirName = fileName.split(".")[0]
        fullDirPath = os.path.join(outDir, dirName)
        os.makedirs(fullDirPath, exist_ok=True)
        doc.saveAs(fullDirPath)
        FreeCAD.closeDocument(doc.Name)
        #FreeCAD.Gui.runCommand('Std_CloseAllWindows',0)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    convert_files()
```

### Why use the save as Directory feature

Reasons:
- non-compressed folder format should work much better with git. Really, a parts library probably doesn't need model files under strict version control. However, since the addonManager is based around git, using it is essentially a predefined constraint on this project. We'll work with what we've got.  
- Saving as directory gives us easy access to `Document.xml` files, as well as thumbnails. (IE we can access them without actually involving the FreeCAD application) - I have ambitions of getting some basic metadata out of files quickly with `xml.etree`

Drawbacks:
- size on disk is ~4x? that of default compressed files. But not doing binary git diffs probably makes up for that.
